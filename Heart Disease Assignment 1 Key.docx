Heart Disease Data Set 

Name_______________________ID_____________________Major_____________________ 

Context 

Coronary heart disease (CHD) involves the reduction of blood flow to the heart muscle due to the build-up of plaque in the arteries of the heart. It is the most common form of cardiovascular disease. Currently, invasive coronary angiography represents the gold standard for establishing the presence, location, and severity of CAD, however, this diagnostic method is costly and associated with morbidity and mortality in CAD patients. Therefore, it would be beneficial to develop a non-invasive alternative to replace the current gold standard. 

Other less invasive diagnostics methods have been proposed in the scientific literature including exercise electrocardiogram, thallium scintigraphy, and fluoroscopy of coronary calcification. However, the diagnostic accuracy of these tests only ranges between 35%-75%. Therefore, it would be beneficial to develop a computer-aided diagnostic tool that could utilize the combined results of these non-invasive tests in conjunction with other patient attributes to boost the diagnostic power of these non-invasive methods with the aim of ultimately replacing the current invasive gold standard. 

A number of 303 consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography at the Cleveland Clinic between May 1981 and September 1984 participated in the experiment. No patient had a history or electrocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial infarction or known valvular or cardiomyopathic diseases.  

About the Dataset 

The dataset comprises 303 observations, 13 features, and 1 target attribute. The 13 features include the results of the aforementioned non-invasive diagnostic tests along with other relevant patient information. The target variable includes the result of the invasive coronary angiogram which represents the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in the patient. The 14 variables (13 features and 1 target attribute) are described below.  

AGE: displays the age of the individual. 

SEX: displays the gender of the individual using the following format: 
1 = male 
0 = female 

CP: displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format: 
0 = typical angina 
1 = atypical angina 
2 = non — anginal pain 
3 = asymptotic 

TRESTBPS: displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit) 

CHOL: displays the serum cholesterol in mg/dl (unit) 

FBS: compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. 
1: fasting blood sugar >120mg/dl 
0: fasting blood sugar ≤ 120mg/dl 

RESTECG: displays resting electrocardiographic results 
0 = normal 
1 = having ST-T wave abnormality 
2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy 

THALACH: displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual. 

EXANG: Exercise induced angina 
1 = yes 
0 = no 

OLDPEAK  ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. Displays the value which is an integer or float. 

SLOPE: Peak exercise ST segment 
1 = upsloping 
2 = flat 
3 = downsloping 

CA: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. Displays the value as integer or float. 

THAL: Displays the thalassemia 
1 = normal 
2 = fixed defect 
3 = reversible defect 

TARGET: Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not : 
0 = absence 
1 = present. 

The data was collected by Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D. of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. See the Appendix at the end of this document for more details on why these variables are used to analyze CHD.
